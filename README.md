    Particle Network BTC Connect B¬≤ Demo
  </h3>
</div>

‚ö°Ô∏è Demo application showcasing the implementation of Particle Network's BTC Connect product to facilitate ERC-4337 Account Abstraction (through native Bitcoin wallets) on B¬≤, a ZK-Rollup for Bitcoin boasting quick transaction speeds, low fees, and of course, data settlement on Bitcoin.

Built using **BTC Connect (by Particle Network)**, **TypeScript**

## ‚Çø BTC Connect
BTC Connect takes advantage of ERC-4337 alongside (Bitcoin) Layer-2 EVM-compatible blockchains to leverage a Smart Account, Paymaster, Bundler natively within Bitcoin wallets (connected to through a Bitcoin-specific modal also provided by BTC Connect). As its core, BTC Connect enables existing BTC wallets to control smart accounts on Layer-2s.
